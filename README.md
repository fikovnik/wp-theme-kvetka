wp-theme-kvetka
===============

Kvetka is a simple minimalistic horizontal theme for [WordPress][1] compatible with version 3.0. The idea is in having a minimalistic theme so the site is more focused on the actual content than the theme itself.

The theme was inspired by the [indexhibit][2] project. Since it's been the first theme I ever did for WordPress I used [hemingway][3] for inspiration on how to do stuff.
